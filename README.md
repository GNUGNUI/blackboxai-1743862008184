# Songs of Salvation - Gospel Lyrics App

## Project Overview
Songs of Salvation is a web application designed to provide users with access to gospel lyrics. The app features a modern and visually appealing interface, allowing users to search for songs, sort them by various criteria, and explore recent uploads. The application aims to serve as a resource for individuals looking for gospel music across different languages and themes.

2. **Change directory into the project:**
   ```bash
   cd songs-of-salvation
